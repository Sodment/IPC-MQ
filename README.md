  # About
 
 Simple IPC between client and server using message queues from MacOS. Project made for my uni classes and I havent catched a lot of errors so use at your own risk. Also remember to delete the message queue after use cuz im stupid and I havent done so in code.
 
 # Compilation
 
 use gcc 
 
 # Run
 
 standard teminal run ./nameoffile
 
 Run server first, then run as many clients as you want (only 2048 clients can be registered tho)
