  # IPC-MQ
Simple IPC between client and server using message queues from MacOS. It is a a crashing experiment of mine
 
 # Compilation
 
``` gcc server.c -o server ```

``` gcc client.c -o client ```
 
 # Run
 
``` ./server ```

``` ./client ```
 
 Run server first, then run as many clients as you want (only 2048 clients can be registered tho)
